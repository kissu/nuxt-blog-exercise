# nuxt-blog-exercise

This project was about trying a first basic CRUD project with Nuxt.
The lesson for it can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/nuxtjs-vuejs-on-steroids).

The aim at the start was to make a blog but it went to some maniac crazy **KITTIES** !

### How is the current website looking

### Todo list
- [x] make some basic views
- [x] refacto the views
- [x] make some CRUD (thanks to FBase)
- [x] _kinda_ persistant auth
- [x] deploy to the *awesome* Netlify ~even if it doesn't handle universal apps~
- [ ] deploy to Heroku and see if it suits the CRUD updates better (`npm run generate && start`)
- [ ] try to [PWA](https://github.com/nuxt-community/pwa-module) the current app
- [ ] see if we can reach 100% audits ?
